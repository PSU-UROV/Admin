This is the beginings of a proposal describing the UROV project, it's history, academic merit, plans, and goals. It is roughly following the format of an NSF grant. It should be turned into Dr. Eric Bodegom(Physics Chair) soon. Afterwards it can be a resource to pull together proposals targeted at individuals or corporations.
EDIT
This is no longer based on NSF grant, PSU-UROV-2010.tex should have no dependencies. The dependency files will remain until all files that depend on them have been purged. As of Sept 3, 2010_summary.tex and proposal_summary.tex are depreciated.
