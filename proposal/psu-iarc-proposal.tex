This is a  proposal to fund the Portland State University Robotics Team to compete in the 2011 International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC) hosted by the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). The team is comprised of students studying mechanical engineering,
 chemistry, computer science, and physics who will build an autonomous robot [to compete in August].  The strengths of the 2011 team are computer programming and experience from previous years. The combination of hard work 
from the team and support from you gives Portland State a realistic chance of winning the International Aerial Robotics Competition.  


\centerline{\bf Results from Prior Competitions}

\noindent
{\bf PSU-ROV 2010}
{\it Total UROV cost: \$2496.06}

In 2010, the Portland State University Robotics Team built a robot for the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center's International Remote Operated Vehicle Competition (IROVC). Out of over four hundred applicants for the combined competition classes, the [Portland Sate University ROV team] passed the local qualification round and went on to participate in the International competition. 
Five students and two mentors went to Hilo, Hawaii to compete. The 2010 ROV received 70/300 mission points and 216/500 total points, 
ranking 18th out of 26 international teams.

{\bf PSU-ROV 2009}
{\it Total UROV cost: \$481.10}

In 2009, the Portland State University ROV team sent three students and one mentor to Boston, Massachusetts, where the robot failed the safety inspection 
due to unforeseen electrical difficulties.  The robot received 0/300 mission points and 80.67/500 for the total score, ranking 28th. 


\section{Introduction}

Autonomous flying vehicles are on the cutting edge of engineering. The IARC is specifically designed so that no existing craft can complete the mission. Because no team could complete the 2010 mission, no new tasks or alterations have been added for the 2011 mission. [There is a \$1,000 entry fee and a \$20,000 grand prize in 2011]. The Portland State team is a veteran of the MATE competition and strong in computer programming. What the team needs in terms of [departmental support] is funding and a place to work. The estimated cost is \$8,000 for construction of the aerial robot and traveling to the competition. The team needs a place to build and test the robot. In past years the team used [lab space], but the construction of the robot was disruptive to the classes and tools were stolen and [setups were broken]. 

\section{Mission}

The craft will have to identify and travel through a one meter square window. There will be a camera with a blue light watching the door. When the light is on, the camera will be off and the craft will have a short time period to enter the building. Once inside, the robot must read signs on the walls written in Arabic, and navigate to a particular office. Next, the robot needs to identify and pick up a USB Flash drive and replace it with an identical one. Finally, the craft needs to escape without being detected. The total time allowed is ten minutes. 
\section{Design}

The flying robot will be a quad-rotor under computer control. The robot will be in radio communication with a remote computer that will handle the complex navigational computation. A laser and a webcam will be used to build a map of forward distances. Infra red light emitting diodes and photo-sensors will be used for proximity detection. Accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers will be used to ensure level flight. 

\section{Time Line}

The final competition will be in August 2011. A first step is to purchase an off-the-shelf quad rotor for testing purposes. This will enable the software and hardware teams to work independently, because otherwise software would be waiting for hardware to build a device and for electrical to make it fly.
